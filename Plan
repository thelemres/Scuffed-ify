Put all songs in one folder

Use metadata of each song to classify
    - Album
        - Track Number
    - Artist
    - Year
    - Genre
    - Title
    
Use Kid3 to add tags to the RIFF INFO (Tag 3) part of the wav

Currently, each wav needs Title and Artist. The Metadata class only grabs title and artist. Has to be modified for adding other fields.
